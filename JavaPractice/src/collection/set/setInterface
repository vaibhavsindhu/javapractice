1: set interface is child interface of collection interface
2: Its unordered collection
3: insertion order not preserved
4: only unique elements can be there
5: set doesn't have its own methods, it uses methods given by collection
    following classes implements set interface

    1: HashSet
        -- under line data structure is Hashtable
        -- no duplicate allowed -- no error but add(); returns false
        -- insertion order not preserved -- insert elements based on hashcode
        -- heterogeneous allowed
        -- null allowed
        -- serializable and cloneable interface
        -- best if search operation is frequent, as stores based on hashcode

    2: LinkedHashSet
        -- Its child class of HashSet
        -- Same as HashSet but Insertion order preserved
        -- underline data structure is hybrid - combination of Linkedlist and Hashtable

    3: SortedSet
        --Its child of Set
        --Duplicates not allowed but elements sorted

            TreeSet
            -- underline DS is balanced tree
            --child class of SortedSet
            --No duplicates
            --Insertion order not preserved
            -- sorted based on elements inserted
            -- heterogeneous not allowed
            -- null allowed but only once
