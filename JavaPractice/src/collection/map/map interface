--Map interface is not part of collection interface
--its separate from collection
--
---Map interface implemented by following classes
           1. HashMap
                -- child class of map
                -- insertion order not preserved
                -- non synchronized
                -- <key,value>
                -- stored in the form of hashcode
                -- underline DS is HashTable
                -- duplicate keys not allowed, value allowed
                -- null allowed once

           2: LinkedHashMap
                -- same as HashMap
                -- underline DS is HashTable+LinedList
                -- synchronized
                -- Insertion order preserved
                -- no duplicate
                -- no null allowed

           3: WeakHashMap
                -- It is same as HashMap except the following difference
                in the case of HashMap even obj does not have any reference it is not eligible for GC
                if it is associated with HashMap...HashMap dominates GC
                --But in the case of WeakHashMap, if obj doesn't contain any references it is eligible for GC
                even though obj is associated with weakHashMap....GC dominates WeakHashMap

            4: SortedMap(I)
                   -- child interface of Map
                   -- if we want to represent a group of key, value pair according to some sorting order
                   then we should go for SortedMap
                   -- Sorting is based on the key
                   --- Sorted map have following methods
                     Object firstKey()

            5: TreeMap(C)
                -- DS is Red black tree
                -- Insertion order not preserved
                -- duplicate keys not allowed
                -- dup values allowed
                -- keys must homogeneous and need to be comparable
                -- no restriction on values
                -- if we are defining our own sorting using comparator then keys need to be homogeneous and
                comparable objects also

            6: NavigableMap
                    --chile Interface of sortedMap
                    -- it defines several methods for navigation
