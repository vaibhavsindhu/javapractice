--Map interface is not part of collection interface
--its separate from collection
--
---Map interface implemented by following classes
           1. HashMap
                -- child class of map
                -- insertion order not preserved
                -- non synchronized
                -- <key,value>
                -- stored in the form of hashcode
                -- underline DS is HashTable
                -- duplicate keys not allowed, value allowed
                -- null allowed once

           2: LinkedHashMap
                -- same as HashMap
                -- underline DS is HashTable+LinedList
                -- synchronized
                -- Insertion order preserved
                -- no duplicate
                -- no null allowed

           3: WeakHashMap
                -- It is same as HashMap except the following difference
                in the case of HashMap even obj does not have any reference it is not eligible for GC
                if it is associated with HashMap...HashMap dominates GC
                --But in the case of WeakHashMap, if obj doesn't contain any references it is eligible for GC
                even though obj is associated with weakHashMap....GC dominates WeakHashMap
